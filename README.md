# discretization
Discretisation - Entropy-based binning (supervised)

Discretization is the process through which we can transform continuous variables, models or functions into a discrete form.

We do this by creating a set of contiguous intervals (or bins) that go across the range of our desired variable/model/function. 

> Continuous data is Measured, while Discrete data is Counted.


Setup:

- python3 -m venv .venv

- source .venv/bin/activate

- python execute.py
